## Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Jilin Zheng.

I am an undergraduate student at Boston University studying Computer Engineering, planned to graduate in December 2025. I am interested in Embedded Systems, High Performance Programming, Robotics, and really anything that serves a meaningful purpose in our complicate world.

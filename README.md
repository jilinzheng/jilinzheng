## Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Jilin Zheng.

I am an undergraduate student at Boston University studying Computer Engineering, planned to graduate in December 2025. I am interested in Embedded Systems, Robotics, low-level/OS-level development, and really anything that serves a meaninful purpose in our complicate world.
